# WordCount Testing
This is the Benchmark documents I used for testing document word counts in https://portfolio.keshuac.com/blog/00003.WordCounts.
- `BaseTest.docx` is a sanity check to check that everything is working, it's word count is 100 words.
- `DocxTest.docx` is the benchmark, its manually counted word count is 219 words.

## How to use
- DocxTest can be exported as a .doc file.
- To check what features are supported in each software, make a copy and delete elements and measure if the word count changes.

### Notes:
The word count for DocxTest is not intended as a target.\
The count includes many things designed to trip up software.\
The benchmark should instead be used to test what features each software supports in their word count algorithms.
